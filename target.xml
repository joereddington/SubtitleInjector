      <p begin="00:00:05.36" id="p2" end="00:00:06.80">The pressure was on...</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:00:06.80" id="p3" end="00:00:09.28">Never bake again.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:09.28" id="p4" end="00:00:11.00">..and the gloves were off...</p>
      <p style="s2" begin="00:00:11.00" id="p5" end="00:00:13.36">If you're going to do a macaron,<br />do it properly.</p>

      <p begin="00:00:21.08" id="p8" end="00:00:24.16">LAUGHTER</p>
      <p begin="00:00:24.16" id="p9" end="00:00:26.44">Oh! Time for An Extra Slice.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:26.44" id="p10" end="00:00:28.64">CHEERING</p>
      <p begin="00:00:49.60" id="p11" end="00:00:51.80">CHEERING</p>
      <p begin="00:00:54.12" id="p12" end="00:00:57.20">Hello, and welcome to the show.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:57.20" id="p13" end="00:01:00.60">It was a chocolate-filled<br />semifinal week in the tent</p>
      <p begin="00:01:00.60" id="p14" end="00:01:02.64">and what a dramatic one.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:02.64" id="p15" end="00:01:06.64">Certainly Paul knew just<br />how important the semifinal was.</p>
      <p style="s2" begin="00:01:06.64" id="p16" end="00:01:09.84">This is their last chance<br />to get into the final next week.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:11.92" id="p17" end="00:01:13.96">Thanks for that, Paul(!)</p>
      <p begin="00:01:13.96" id="p18" end="00:01:16.72">We now know who the three<br />Bake Off finalists are,</p>
      <p begin="00:01:16.72" id="p19" end="00:01:19.24">and the title<br />could go to any one of them.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:19.24" id="p20" end="00:01:23.40">Yes, it's congratulations<br />to Ian, Nadiya and Tamal.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:23.40" id="p21" end="00:01:25.68">CHEERING</p>
      <p begin="00:01:29.36" id="p22" end="00:01:33.72">Sadly, the semifinal<br />also saw Flora twirl her last tuile</p>
      <p begin="00:01:33.72" id="p23" end="00:01:35.68">and leave the tent.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:35.68" id="p24" end="00:01:39.08">The good news is that<br />she'll be joining us later.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:39.08" id="p25" end="00:01:43.28">She's just finishing off her bake by<br />adding the final decorative touches</p>
      <p begin="00:01:43.28" id="p26" end="00:01:45.88">of macaron, amaretti,<br />truffles, caramel,</p>
      <p begin="00:01:45.88" id="p27" end="00:01:49.28">pomegranate, edible gold<br />and a bit of piping.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:49.28" id="p28" end="00:01:53.12">Meanwhile, after cutting back<br />on the size of her glasses of sherry,</p>
      <p begin="00:01:53.12" id="p29" end="00:01:56.56">Mary's determined<br />to let her hair down after the final.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:01:56.56" id="p30" end="00:01:58.36">Next week, I'll have big ones.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:01.08" id="p31" end="00:02:02.56">Back to this week,</p>
      <p begin="00:02:02.56" id="p32" end="00:02:07.12">and Paul exclusively revealed the<br />name of his new fragrance for men.</p>
      <p style="s2" begin="00:02:07.12" id="p33" end="00:02:09.36">Pure Bake Off magic.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:11.12" id="p34" end="00:02:13.08">As ever, we'll be steeling ourselves</p>
      <p begin="00:02:13.08" id="p35" end="00:02:15.52">to take a look<br />at what you've been baking at home.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:15.52" id="p36" end="00:02:17.00">And I'm delighted to see</p>
      <p begin="00:02:17.00" id="p37" end="00:02:19.88">that we've got an entire studio<br />full of chocolatiers.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:19.88" id="p38" end="00:02:21.96">Let's have a look at your bakes.</p>

      <p begin="00:02:31.84" id="p40" end="00:02:35.88">I was a bit worried we'd turn into<br />the Choccy Horror Show.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:35.88" id="p41" end="00:02:39.40">But they look fantastic.<br />We'll be tasting a few in a bit.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:39.40" id="p42" end="00:02:41.68">But now, let's meet tonight's panel.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:41.68" id="p43" end="00:02:45.16">First up, it's one of Britain's<br />most acclaimed Michelin-starred chefs</p>
      <p begin="00:02:45.16" id="p44" end="00:02:47.88">who says he's fanatical<br />about vanilla ice cream.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:47.88" id="p45" end="00:02:50.84">It's Tom Aikens. <span tts:color="cyan">Hello.</span></p>
      <p begin="00:02:50.84" id="p46" end="00:02:52.88">CHEERING</p>
      <p begin="00:02:53.96" id="p47" end="00:02:57.80">Next, it's a man who once confessed<br />he used to smell his mum's shoes</p>
      <p begin="00:02:57.80" id="p48" end="00:03:00.32">when she came home<br />from working in a chocolate factory.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:00.32" id="p49" end="00:03:01.72">It's Danny Baker. <span tts:color="yellow">Thank you.</span></p>

      <p begin="00:03:06.32" id="p51" end="00:03:09.68">And a comedian who says he doesn't<br />believe in eating chocolate</p>
      <p begin="00:03:09.68" id="p52" end="00:03:11.76">within the context of pastry.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:11.76" id="p53" end="00:03:13.24">It's Josh Widdicombe.</p>

      <p begin="00:03:19.36" id="p56" end="00:03:22.80">So, Danny, your mum worked<br />in a chocolate factory. <span tts:color="yellow">Yes, she did.</span></p>
      <p begin="00:03:22.80" id="p57" end="00:03:24.20">One point.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:24.20" id="p58" end="00:03:27.52">That still doesn't really explain<br />why you used to smell her shoes.</p>
      <p style="s3" begin="00:03:27.52" id="p59" end="00:03:30.28">Because she had special work shoes,<br />they were Dr Scholl.</p>
      <p style="s3" begin="00:03:30.28" id="p60" end="00:03:31.92">She only worked in those.</p>
      <p style="s3" begin="00:03:31.92" id="p61" end="00:03:34.56">And when she used to come home<br />with those in her bag,</p>
      <p style="s3" begin="00:03:34.56" id="p62" end="00:03:36.64">if she hadn't brought home<br />any chocolate...</p>
      <p style="s3" begin="00:03:36.64" id="p63" end="00:03:39.00">Usually, when she was working<br />on violet creams...</p>
      <p style="s3" begin="00:03:39.00" id="p64" end="00:03:42.32">This wasn't three weeks ago.<br />This was when I was about six.</p>
      <p style="s3" begin="00:03:42.32" id="p65" end="00:03:44.56">I used to get the soles of her shoes<br />and think,</p>
      <p style="s3" begin="00:03:44.56" id="p66" end="00:03:46.60">"What must it be like<br />to work there?"</p>
      <p begin="00:03:46.60" id="p67" end="00:03:47.72">HE SNIFFS</p>
      <p style="s3" begin="00:03:47.72" id="p68" end="00:03:49.88">She went on to work<br />in a biscuit factory after that.</p>
      <p style="s3" begin="00:03:49.88" id="p69" end="00:03:51.28">I used to smell her pockets then,</p>
      <p style="s3" begin="00:03:51.28" id="p70" end="00:03:53.40">because she used to put biscuits<br />in her pockets.</p>
      <p style="s3" begin="00:03:53.40" id="p71" end="00:03:55.84">I know. I'm an old fetishist.</p>
      <p style="s3" begin="00:03:55.84" id="p72" end="00:03:57.96">But, yeah, I did smell her shoes.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:57.96" id="p73" end="00:04:01.08">Now, Tom, what's the most chocolaty<br />chocolate dessert you serve</p>
      <p begin="00:04:01.08" id="p74" end="00:04:03.84">in your Michelin-starred<br />restaurants?</p>
      <p style="s2" begin="00:04:03.84" id="p75" end="00:04:06.00">Very difficult, but I made a...</p>
      <p style="s2" begin="00:04:06.00" id="p76" end="00:04:08.88">This holiday, I made a chocolate<br />birthday cake for someone.</p>
      <p style="s2" begin="00:04:08.88" id="p77" end="00:04:13.88">And it was 20 thin chocolate crepes<br />sandwiched between chocolate mousse,</p>
      <p style="s2" begin="00:04:13.88" id="p78" end="00:04:16.56">covered in a ganache,<br />sprinkled on a load of praline,</p>
      <p style="s2" begin="00:04:16.56" id="p79" end="00:04:20.56">and then a big bowl<br />of golden caramel sponge sugar.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:20.56" id="p80" end="00:04:24.24">Would you mind doing one of those<br />for me for later? <span tts:color="cyan">Absolutely.</span></p>
      <p style="s2" begin="00:04:24.24" id="p81" end="00:04:26.08">No problem.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:26.08" id="p82" end="00:04:27.88">What's the weirdest thing, Josh,</p>
      <p begin="00:04:27.88" id="p83" end="00:04:30.68">you've ever encountered<br />made out of chocolate?</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:04:30.68" id="p84" end="00:04:34.32">Well, once, when I was a kid,<br />my parents went to Brussels</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:04:34.32" id="p85" end="00:04:37.68">and you know there's a statue<br />of the weeing boy?</p>
      <p style="s2" begin="00:04:37.68" id="p86" end="00:04:39.12"><span tts:color="yellow">Yes. </span>This sounds weird.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:04:39.12" id="p87" end="00:04:41.52">It WAS weird,<br />cos they brought me back</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:04:41.52" id="p88" end="00:04:44.12">a statue of the boy weeing<br />made of chocolate.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:04:44.12" id="p89" end="00:04:46.52">But I'd got no knowledge<br />of the statue.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:04:47.68" id="p90" end="00:04:51.20">So, out of context,<br />it felt like a very weird gift.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:52.64" id="p91" end="00:04:54.16">OK, let's treat ourselves</p>
      <p begin="00:04:54.16" id="p92" end="00:04:57.04">to a look at the baking<br />you've been doing at home.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:57.04" id="p93" end="00:04:58.88">What I love best about your pictures</p>
      <p begin="00:04:58.88" id="p94" end="00:05:02.20">is that it means your bakes<br />aren't here in the studio,</p>
      <p begin="00:05:02.20" id="p95" end="00:05:04.20">where we might have to eat them.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:05.20" id="p96" end="00:05:09.68">Now, Lynne has been busy recreating<br />bakes from inside the tent.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:09.68" id="p97" end="00:05:12.72">Here's Lynne's version<br />of Tamal's charlotte russe.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:12.72" id="p98" end="00:05:14.68">AUDIENCE: <span tts:color="lime">Ooooh!</span></p>
      <p begin="00:05:14.68" id="p99" end="00:05:16.24">That's amazing, isn't it?</p>
      <p begin="00:05:16.24" id="p100" end="00:05:19.40">And even more amazing<br />when you see it next to a penny.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:22.56" id="p101" end="00:05:24.80">Lynne also has the solution<br />for those of us</p>
      <p begin="00:05:24.80" id="p102" end="00:05:28.44">who wanted to eat all three layers<br />of Ian's triple-tiered cheesecake.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:31.40" id="p103" end="00:05:34.60">She's also made a miniature version<br />of Flora's macaron,</p>
      <p begin="00:05:34.60" id="p104" end="00:05:37.08">but she sneezed<br />and now she can't find them.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:38.92" id="p105" end="00:05:42.08">Now, as Rugby World Cup fever<br />sweeps the nation,</p>
      <p begin="00:05:42.08" id="p106" end="00:05:44.40">Alexander was inspired<br />to bake eclairs</p>
      <p begin="00:05:44.40" id="p107" end="00:05:48.40">as a glorious celebration of<br />the flags of all competing nations.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:48.40" id="p108" end="00:05:50.64">So, let's see who's taking part.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:50.64" id="p109" end="00:05:52.52">So...</p>
      <p begin="00:05:54.04" id="p110" end="00:05:55.68">Er...</p>
      <p begin="00:05:55.68" id="p111" end="00:05:57.20">Scotland.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:57.20" id="p112" end="00:06:00.24">And moving on... Um...</p>
      <p begin="00:06:00.24" id="p113" end="00:06:03.40">Eileen from Wiltshire<br />made a birthday cake for her son</p>
      <p begin="00:06:03.40" id="p114" end="00:06:05.92">in the shape of his teddy bear -<br />here's the teddy.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:07.00" id="p115" end="00:06:09.48">Ahhh! All soft, cuddly and warm.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:09.48" id="p116" end="00:06:11.32">And here's Eileen's cake.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:16.72" id="p117" end="00:06:18.96">Less sort of teddy bear,</p>
      <p begin="00:06:18.96" id="p118" end="00:06:20.88">more Teddy Krueger, really.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:22.24" id="p119" end="00:06:25.64">Finally, Rachel in Dubai<br />made a cake for her friend Annabelle</p>
      <p begin="00:06:25.64" id="p120" end="00:06:28.60">inspired by Annabelle's cat, Tigs -<br />here's Tigs.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:29.76" id="p121" end="00:06:31.32">Isn't he cute?</p>
      <p begin="00:06:31.32" id="p122" end="00:06:32.60">And let's see how accurately</p>
      <p begin="00:06:32.60" id="p123" end="00:06:35.88">Annabelle managed<br />to capture his likeness.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:35.88" id="p124" end="00:06:38.04">Oh, come on!</p>
      <p style="s3" begin="00:06:38.04" id="p125" end="00:06:39.44">No!</p>
      <p begin="00:06:41.68" id="p126" end="00:06:45.04">We love seeing your photos, the<br />masterpieces and the disaster-pieces.</p>

      <p begin="00:06:56.68" id="p131" end="00:07:01.12">Back to the tent now,<br />and turn the stress-o-meter to 11</p>
      <p begin="00:07:01.12" id="p132" end="00:07:05.52">as we remind ourselves what happened<br />in the penultimate week in the tent.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:07.64" id="p133" end="00:07:12.08">It was the Bake Off semis...<br /><span tts:color="lime">Semifinals!</span></p>
      <p begin="00:07:12.08" id="p134" end="00:07:16.12">..with just four bakers<br />battling for a place in the final.</p>
      <p style="s3" begin="00:07:16.12" id="p135" end="00:07:18.36">Everything has to be tickety-boo.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:18.36" id="p136" end="00:07:20.72">The deceptively simple Signature...</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:07:20.72" id="p137" end="00:07:23.48">Just another day,<br />it's just another chocolate tart.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:23.48" id="p138" end="00:07:25.96">..had to be simply perfect.</p>
      <p style="s2" begin="00:07:25.96" id="p139" end="00:07:28.92">It's not good.<br />It's overbaked, dry as a bone.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:28.92" id="p140" end="00:07:31.76">The bakers were staggered<br />by the Technical.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:07:31.76" id="p141" end="00:07:34.28">What?! Don't go!</p>
      <p begin="00:07:34.28" id="p142" end="00:07:36.36">A speedy chocolate souffle.</p>
      <p style="s3" begin="00:07:37.48" id="p143" end="00:07:40.48">Make souffle?<br />I think I'll eat my hat.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:40.48" id="p144" end="00:07:42.80">And in the nail-biting Showstopper...</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:07:42.80" id="p145" end="00:07:45.08">Oh, come on. That's not funny.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:45.08" id="p146" end="00:07:49.16">..they went all out to impress<br />with a three-D chocolate centrepiece.</p>
      <p style="s3" begin="00:07:49.16" id="p147" end="00:07:51.20">We asked for something spectacular.</p>
      <p style="s3" begin="00:07:51.20" id="p148" end="00:07:54.04">We certainly have got<br />something spectacular.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:54.04" id="p149" end="00:07:57.52">Nadiya won Star Baker<br />for a third time.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:57.52" id="p150" end="00:08:00.24">And, sadly, Flora left the tent.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:02.08" id="p151" end="00:08:05.28">Which means Tamal, Nadiya and Ian</p>
      <p begin="00:08:05.28" id="p152" end="00:08:10.76">will battle it out in the 2015<br />Great British Bake Off final.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:12.40" id="p153" end="00:08:14.16">CHEERING</p>
      <p begin="00:08:16.60" id="p154" end="00:08:19.96">Now, that was definitely<br />the tensest tent so far.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:19.96" id="p155" end="00:08:22.40">Danny, do you enjoy the tension,<br />or...?</p>
      <p style="s3" begin="00:08:22.40" id="p156" end="00:08:24.72">That was an extraordinary episode<br />this week.</p>
      <p style="s3" begin="00:08:24.72" id="p157" end="00:08:26.36">There's everything there.</p>
      <p style="s3" begin="00:08:26.36" id="p158" end="00:08:28.40">And that five minutes<br />with the souffle thing,</p>
      <p style="s3" begin="00:08:28.40" id="p159" end="00:08:31.68">it shows you, you don't need<br />a darkened studio, tense music.</p>
      <p style="s3" begin="00:08:31.68" id="p160" end="00:08:35.44">If you can get a little tent,<br />baking, and a sunny day,</p>
      <p style="s3" begin="00:08:35.44" id="p161" end="00:08:38.60">and still have that breathless,<br />Hitchcockian...</p>
      <p style="s3" begin="00:08:38.60" id="p162" end="00:08:43.40">It was. It was absolutely<br />terrifying. <span tts:color="cyan">Drama. </span>It really was.</p>
      <p style="s3" begin="00:08:43.40" id="p163" end="00:08:46.12">Yeah, it was absolutely fantastic<br />television.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:08:46.12" id="p164" end="00:08:49.28">It felt finally like when I have to<br />make something in the kitchen.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:08:49.28" id="p165" end="00:08:50.76"><span tts:color="cyan">Stressful. </span>Yeah.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:08:50.76" id="p166" end="00:08:53.80">That was me making cheese on toast,<br />that's what that was.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:08:53.80" id="p167" end="00:08:56.12">Cos they had the two paperclips</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:08:56.12" id="p168" end="00:09:00.52">and I like the thought of them<br />going, "Should I put them in?"</p>
      <p style="s3" begin="00:09:02.52" id="p169" end="00:09:05.36">And when she was left<br />at the beginning on her own,</p>
      <p style="s3" begin="00:09:05.36" id="p170" end="00:09:06.88">you thought, this is harsh.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:06.88" id="p171" end="00:09:11.16">This is the first time that they'd<br />ever done that on Bake Off. <span tts:color="yellow">Yeah.</span></p>
      <p begin="00:09:11.16" id="p172" end="00:09:13.92">You know, that someone had to start -<br />Flora, in this case -</p>
      <p begin="00:09:13.92" id="p173" end="00:09:16.40">making something, the souffle,<br />by herself.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:16.40" id="p174" end="00:09:19.60">I was watching it, for a minute,<br />I thought they were making</p>
      <p begin="00:09:19.60" id="p175" end="00:09:22.28">the Scottish contestants<br />bake independently.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:23.72" id="p176" end="00:09:26.68">Meanwhile, Paul and Mary decided<br />to ring the changes</p>
      <p begin="00:09:26.68" id="p177" end="00:09:28.92">by pretending to be judges<br />on The Voice.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:33.00" id="p178" end="00:09:35.12">Now, we saw how relieved Ian was.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:35.12" id="p179" end="00:09:37.48">Do you think<br />he deserved to stay over Flora?</p>
      <p style="s3" begin="00:09:37.48" id="p180" end="00:09:39.52">When you get to a semifinal,<br />obviously,</p>
      <p style="s3" begin="00:09:39.52" id="p181" end="00:09:42.48">and it's not like the early rounds<br />where someone's really rotten</p>
      <p style="s3" begin="00:09:42.48" id="p182" end="00:09:44.12">and you can say, well, they're gone.</p>
      <p style="s3" begin="00:09:44.12" id="p183" end="00:09:45.84">I thought Ian was going to go.</p>
      <p style="s3" begin="00:09:45.84" id="p184" end="00:09:48.20">And Flora actually won<br />one of the rounds.</p>
      <p style="s3" begin="00:09:48.20" id="p185" end="00:09:50.88">I think you've really got to mess up<br />on the other two to go home,</p>
      <p style="s3" begin="00:09:50.88" id="p186" end="00:09:52.28">and she didn't, really.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:09:52.28" id="p187" end="00:09:54.80">No, it was a huge injustice.<br />He made a well.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:09:54.80" id="p188" end="00:09:59.32">That's not a bake. <span tts:color="yellow">No.<br /></span>That's what you do on a year out.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:10:03.16" id="p189" end="00:10:04.68">I...</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:10:04.68" id="p190" end="00:10:07.88">I don't know. I'm going to throw it<br />out there. <span tts:color="cyan">Go on, throw it.</span></p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:10:07.88" id="p191" end="00:10:09.96">Is chocolate baking?</p>
      <p begin="00:10:09.96" id="p192" end="00:10:12.00"><span tts:color="cyan">Is it?<br /></span>AUDIENCE: <span tts:color="yellow">Oooh.</span></p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:10:12.00" id="p193" end="00:10:14.44">Or is it moulding chocolate?<br />Do you know what I mean?</p>
      <p begin="00:10:14.44" id="p194" end="00:10:17.20">Well, Ian's well had biscuits<br />round it, didn't it?</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:10:17.20" id="p195" end="00:10:19.56">We've all got biscuits round stuff.</p>
      <p style="s3" begin="00:10:19.56" id="p196" end="00:10:23.40">Exactly. Using that logic, Jo,<br />a cup of tea is baking.</p>
      <p begin="00:10:24.72" id="p197" end="00:10:29.68">Well, I'm only trying to offer<br />an alternative view.</p>
      <p begin="00:10:32.08" id="p198" end="00:10:35.72">Let's turn to Nadiya now,<br />who equalled Ian's achievement</p>
      <p begin="00:10:35.72" id="p199" end="00:10:39.04">by being crowned Star Baker<br />for a third time.</p>
      <p begin="00:10:39.04" id="p200" end="00:10:43.28">Do you agree, Tom,<br />that Nadiya deserved Star Baker?</p>
      <p style="s2" begin="00:10:43.28" id="p201" end="00:10:46.00">I think, overall,<br />she's been quite consistent.</p>
      <p style="s2" begin="00:10:46.00" id="p202" end="00:10:48.40">Her chocolate tart,<br />I thought, was exceptional.</p>
      <p style="s2" begin="00:10:48.40" id="p203" end="00:10:50.64">I actually do one as well,<br />so chocolate and caramel,</p>
      <p style="s2" begin="00:10:50.64" id="p204" end="00:10:53.04">and I thought it could have been<br />almost as good as mine.</p>
      <p style="s2" begin="00:10:53.04" id="p205" end="00:10:54.56">And then the peacock...</p>
      <p style="s2" begin="00:10:54.56" id="p206" end="00:10:56.96">The peacock itself, I thought,<br />was extraordinary.</p>
      <p style="s2" begin="00:10:56.96" id="p207" end="00:10:59.12">All the levels of detail,<br />the different tastes,</p>
      <p style="s2" begin="00:10:59.12" id="p208" end="00:11:01.80">the different crunch,<br />the different levels of chocolate,</p>
      <p style="s2" begin="00:11:01.80" id="p209" end="00:11:05.28">you know, from piped into spread<br />into mousse and everything.</p>
      <p style="s2" begin="00:11:05.28" id="p210" end="00:11:07.32">I mean, it was perfect, for me.<br />Brilliant.</p>
      <p style="s3" begin="00:11:07.32" id="p211" end="00:11:10.04">I saw her on week one... Like when<br />my dad used to watch Miss World.</p>
      <p style="s3" begin="00:11:10.04" id="p212" end="00:11:12.28">He'd say... As soon as<br />they all came out, he'd say,</p>
      <p style="s3" begin="00:11:12.28" id="p213" end="00:11:15.04">"Miss Sri Lanka, she wins it,"<br />and I did that with her.</p>
      <p style="s3" begin="00:11:15.04" id="p214" end="00:11:17.00">So I've got a vested interest here,</p>
      <p style="s3" begin="00:11:17.00" id="p215" end="00:11:19.08">but I think she's smart,<br />she's funny,</p>
      <p style="s3" begin="00:11:19.08" id="p216" end="00:11:22.20">she knows how to quip to camera,<br />and she's quite, quite brilliant.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:11:22.20" id="p217" end="00:11:24.40">Yeah, she's great, isn't she?</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:11:24.40" id="p218" end="00:11:27.32">I just think<br />she's timing her run perfectly.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:11:27.32" id="p219" end="00:11:30.08">I think the more difficult it's got,<br />the better she's got. <span tts:color="yellow">Yeah.</span></p>
      <p begin="00:11:30.08" id="p220" end="00:11:33.68">I thought that the peacock<br />Nadiya made was really impressive,</p>
      <p begin="00:11:33.68" id="p221" end="00:11:37.64">cos I can spend hours in the kitchen<br />just looking for a Penguin.</p>
      <p begin="00:11:39.44" id="p222" end="00:11:40.96">Now, I don't know if you noticed,</p>
      <p begin="00:11:40.96" id="p223" end="00:11:43.92">but Mel happened to be wearing<br />a T-shirt with a peacock on it,</p>
      <p begin="00:11:43.92" id="p224" end="00:11:45.60">although if you didn't know that,</p>
      <p begin="00:11:45.60" id="p225" end="00:11:49.80">you'd be forgiven for thinking<br />this bit of unseen footage a bit odd.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:11:49.80" id="p226" end="00:11:52.24">Nadiya, if you need inspiration<br />throughout the day...</p>
      <p style="s2" begin="00:11:52.24" id="p227" end="00:11:53.84">We know where to go!</p>
      <p begin="00:12:01.08" id="p228" end="00:12:05.92">I thought I'd have a go at making<br />a spectacular three-D centrepiece,</p>
      <p begin="00:12:05.92" id="p229" end="00:12:07.64">and I found my inspiration</p>
      <p begin="00:12:07.64" id="p230" end="00:12:11.68">by asking myself what would I like<br />to see in the middle of my table</p>
      <p begin="00:12:11.68" id="p231" end="00:12:14.56">that was made of chocolate?</p>
      <p begin="00:12:14.56" id="p232" end="00:12:17.04">And the answer was...</p>
      <p begin="00:12:20.40" id="p233" end="00:12:22.56">See, that... <span tts:color="yellow">That's good. </span>Yeah.</p>
      <p style="s3" begin="00:12:22.56" id="p234" end="00:12:25.96">That's good.<br /><span tts:color="white">That's gorgeous, isn't it? </span>Beautiful.</p>
      <p begin="00:12:25.96" id="p235" end="00:12:28.68">The thing is, I'm no good<br />at doing those twiddly little bits</p>
      <p begin="00:12:28.68" id="p236" end="00:12:31.36">that add the finishing touch<br />to a creation.</p>
      <p begin="00:12:31.36" id="p237" end="00:12:35.96">If only there was a baker here<br />to add that little something extra.</p>
      <p begin="00:12:37.68" id="p238" end="00:12:39.76">CHEERING</p>
      <p begin="00:12:45.40" id="p239" end="00:12:47.44">Flora, thank you.</p>
      <p begin="00:12:47.44" id="p240" end="00:12:51.68">We'll see you in a bit. That is<br />brilliant. Thank you so much. What...</p>
      <p begin="00:12:51.68" id="p241" end="00:12:53.64">I'm proud.</p>
      <p begin="00:12:53.64" id="p242" end="00:12:55.12">CHEERING</p>
      <p begin="00:12:55.12" id="p243" end="00:12:58.68">And she's just popping it in<br />the freezer, like she normally does.</p>
      <p begin="00:12:58.68" id="p244" end="00:13:01.16">Now, let's talk about Tamal.</p>
      <p begin="00:13:01.16" id="p245" end="00:13:04.04">After struggling with time<br />in previous challenges,</p>
      <p begin="00:13:04.04" id="p246" end="00:13:06.92">he took a simple approach<br />to his Signature</p>
      <p begin="00:13:06.92" id="p247" end="00:13:09.16">with his chocolate New York pie.</p>
      <p begin="00:13:09.16" id="p248" end="00:13:14.44">Was it brave of Tamal to go simple<br />in the semifinal Signature, Tom?</p>
      <p style="s2" begin="00:13:14.44" id="p249" end="00:13:17.36">You know what?<br />Sometimes, being simple can work.</p>
      <p style="s2" begin="00:13:17.36" id="p250" end="00:13:18.80">He's not trying to be magical,</p>
      <p style="s2" begin="00:13:18.80" id="p251" end="00:13:21.12">he's not trying to be<br />overly-creative.</p>
      <p style="s2" begin="00:13:21.12" id="p252" end="00:13:23.96">And the dishes that he's putting up,<br />you know, they all work.</p>
      <p style="s2" begin="00:13:23.96" id="p253" end="00:13:26.92">They're not sort of the whistles<br />and bells that Flora has done.</p>
      <p style="s2" begin="00:13:26.92" id="p254" end="00:13:29.48">But they're very simple,<br />technically been very good.</p>
      <p style="s2" begin="00:13:29.48" id="p255" end="00:13:31.28">And, you know, they all love them.</p>
      <p style="s3" begin="00:13:31.28" id="p256" end="00:13:33.52">If anyone had a game plan,<br />he certainly did.</p>
